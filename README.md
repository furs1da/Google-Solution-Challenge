#THIS IS A PROJECT (SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) IS DEDICATED TO HELP AND MAKE ONLINE PART OF EDUCATION MORE STRUCTERED AND COMFORTABLE

**Version 1.0.0 **

Most of the school in my area use 3 different services to make online education be possible: Google Site (for posting materials), 
Gmail (for submitting assignments) and Atoms (for grades). I think that these all processes should be structured and accessible only in 1 app 
and it might be free, so I decided to make this project.

This project is made using ReactJS as a client-side, ASP.Net Core 3.1 as a server-side and MSSQL as a database engine. If you want to test this project and need a database copy, contact me through furs1268@gmail.com. 

If you will have some problems with database connection when you tried to test this project, change default connection in appconfig and then just try to regenerate migrations and then delete the Migrations folder.
