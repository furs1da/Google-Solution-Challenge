#THIS IS A PROJECT (SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) IS DEDICATED TO HELP AND MAKE ONLINE PART OF EDUCATION MORE STRUCTERED AND COMFORTABLE

**Version 1.0.0 **

Most of the school in my area use 3 different services to make online education be possible: Google Site (for posting materials), 
Gmail (for submitting assignments) and Atoms (for grades). I think that these all processes should be structured and accessible only in 1 app 
and it might be free, so I decided to make this project.

This project is made using ReactJS as a client-side, ASP.Net Core 3.1 as a server-side and SQL Server from Google Cloud as a database engine. 

Accounts to check system's functions: (password - 123456 everywhere)
