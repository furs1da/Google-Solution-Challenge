# School Management System
## THIS IS A PROJECT (SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) IS DEDICATED TO HELP AND MAKE ONLINE PART OF EDUCATION MORE STRUCTERED AND COMFORTABLE

**Version 1.0.0 **

Most of the school in my home country (Ukraine) use 3 different services to make online education be possible: Google Site (for posting materials), 
Gmail (for submitting assignments) and Atoms (for grades). I thought that all these processes should be structured and accessible only in 1 app 
and it might be free, so I decided to make this project.

This project is made using ReactJS as a client-side, ASP.Net Core 3.1 as a server-side and SQL Server from Google Cloud as a database engine. 

List of roles:
  * [School Administration](#administration)
  * [Teacher - Classroom Teacher](#teacher)
  * [Student](#student)
  * [Parent](#parent)
